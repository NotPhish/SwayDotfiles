# SwayDotfiles

These are my current dotfiles for Sway WM, duh....

What you'll need:
    - Maple Mono Font
    - Maple Mono NF Font
    - Sway (pretty obvious)
    - Waybar
    - Swaybg (For wallpapers)

To install the packages, just copy this command:

    - `sudo pacman -Sy sway waybar swaybg`

    If you want to use the Maple Mono fonts:

    1. Download the normal and NF Fonts from the Repository
        - https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font/releases/tag/v7.4

    2. Unpack the fonts via your file browser and move them to 
    `/usr/local/share/fonts/`, here the command:
        - `sudo mv /path/to/font /usr/local/share/fonts/`
        (don't forget the sudo!)

# Important

This is the Jinx themed version, if you by any chance don't like either Arcane nor Jinx, this isn't for you :3
